Represents work in progress and later revisions might be undo some of this invasiveness. This is a very large commit so read on for more detail
- PaymentInfo has been renamed to OrderPayment
- PaymentInfoDetail has been renamed to PaymentTransaction
- Payment workflows have completely gone away and thus the application of payments to an order has been decoupled from invoking checkout
- Better javadocs across all of the payment domain (although by no means are complete)
- Deprecate/remove any baked-in dependency on anything that implements Referenced. Use of entities implementing this interface should be treated as an edge-case rather than the common case
- Move the Referenced entity into their own packages"

Instead, return blank.   The new property to drive this behavior is named ""returnBlankTranslationForNotDefaultLocale"".

This is because all page template fields currently go through translation provider (even fields like ID) which are not even translatable.

Previously, the cache key was set as `""SC|"" + sc.getId()` when an SC item DTO was added to the cache.
However, when the remove method was called when the cache was invalidated, the buildNameKey method was used,
which built the key very differently. Also, the way which site was in use for the SC item was inconsistent
with how it is determined elsewhere.

- Key now always set using key builder methods
- Use the request context to find the site instead of the SC item, because the latter resulted in incorrect keys being set initially
- Added boolean for ""secure"" to key builders
- Refactored `removeStrcucturedContentFromCache` to retry on failed removal and check if the sandbox was `null` when the item was originally added to the cache.
- Deprecated `removeItemFromCache` in favor of `removeItemFromCacheByKey` to reduce duplicate code
- Deprecated `buildTypeKey` in favor of `buildTypeKeyWithSecure`"

This method invokes `org.owasp.esapi.Validator#isValidRedirectLocation` to provide validation of URL redirects. The ESAPI method only works with relative URLs; therefore, the `validateUrl` method strips the scheme, server name, and port (if applicable) from the URL before validating. This method throws and `IOException` if the URL does not pass validation. Originally, this would encode the URL; however, you cannot encode a full or relative URL without getting an invalid URL. Encoding is for parameters."

Previously, the cache key was set as `""SC|"" + sc.getId()` when an SC item DTO was added to the cache.
However, when the remove method was called when the cache was invalidated, the buildNameKey method was used,
which built the key very differently. Also, the way which site was in use for the SC item was inconsistent
with how it is determined elsewhere.

- Key now always set using key builder methods
- Use the request context to find the site instead of the SC item, because the latter resulted in incorrect keys being set initially
- Added boolean for ""secure"" to key builders
- Refactored `removeStrcucturedContentFromCache` to retry on failed removal and check if the sandbox was `null` when the item was originally added to the cache.
- Deprecated `removeItemFromCache` in favor of `removeItemFromCacheByKey` to reduce duplicate code

When switching between sandboxes, ESAPI would throw a validation error for the redirect produced because it is not subordinate to `/admin` or `/login`, and ESAPI does not let you use a full URL to validate redirects, only relative URLs. Therefore, I moved away from ESAPI in this instance.

Instead, I take the request base URL and compare that to the site base url to make sure they are the same. We do not want to be redirected to some other domain or a malicious page. (By default, when you change sandboxes, you are sent back to the index page (i.e., `/`).) If not valid, then it is a security error. After that check, if the URL param ""blSandboxId"" is present, we check to make sure that the sandbox it references actually exists. We also ignore all other parameters, because there should not be any."

The main reason to do this is because registering PropertySources with a BeanFactoryPostProcessor means that we cannot use these properties to drive @ConditionalOnProperty, since they weren't registered early enough. An ApplicationListener is activated immediately after the ApplicationContext has been created and it is a well-defined hookpoint in various places within Spring.

This did require some changes in how we do test configuration (since we
need eo specify the initializerClasses now in the
@ContextConfiguration). This also means that since @PropertySource
annotations are not determined until the ConfigurationClassParser runs
the framework properties will take precedence over any properties
defined there. If someone is using Spring Boot though, anything in
application.properties overrides any of the Broadleaf properties.

Since this is the case, I have also changed how the PropertySources are
registered within the Spring Environment. Previously every
PropertySource from the framework or profile was registered individually
in the Environment. This is now a CompositePropertySource for profile
and framework properties so that you can reorder or change all of them
as a single unit.

This adds some exploratory testing to validate the above assumptions of
how things work."

This will reduce the number of queries made in this context from 1 per URI per 10 minutes, to 1 per URI per day, unless the cmsPageCache is invalidated due to sandbox changes.

`findPageBy()` looks up pages that are active and online at the **date** of the request (the **date** is cached for 10 minutes). These changes will change that interval to **1 day** and account for potential cache invalidations due to changes to the production page (deploys) by checking the **cmsPageCache** before checking the query date cache. The new method, `findPageByURIAndActiveDate()`, retrieves Pages that are active at the time of the cached date and up to a day later. Because we cache the query for a day, we need to retrieve all pages that will be active any time during that interval even if they aren't active for the entire interval. Therefore, we then need to manually remove any pages that aren't active right now.

Spring boot uses the spring.http.multipart.max-file-size property to configure file upload size in the DispatcherServlet. If this limit is not set, then there is no hope for the admin asset uploads to ever get to the underlying storage service in the first place. Thus, for general asset uploads, it does not make sense to require an _additional_ property for asset.server.max.uploadable.file.size (which is Broadleaf-specific) be set to to further enforce these upload limits.

For backwards compatibility, if this asset.server.max.uploadable.file.size is found to be set in the environment (via properties file or other means), we will use it both within the StaticAssetStorageService as well as when we create the MultipartConfigElement to restrict asset upload sizes. This has been removed from the Broadleaf properties files to allow for null checks for determining if the property was actually set by a user or not.

Related to #1831 which kicked off the majority of these changes to begin with."

Then, we realized that even on edits it was possible to click the translations link too quickly and get a display without some styling. This was ""fixed"" in BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommercePrivate/pull/919. However, that essentially reverts the change in BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommercePrivate#908 because now _all_ translation links get un-disabled, no matter if they are on the 'Add' or 'Edit'. Finally, this underwent another change to work with modals in #1828.

This PR basically re-fixes the original BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommercePrivate#908 change to only activate translations if there is a backing id, which usually is in the case of an edit. This also includes a helpful message to indicate why the translations link is disabled."

This also removes our need to prevent Spring from managing the connection for us, and our custom code to tell Spring how to Proxy the entity manager. If we were to leave the proxy implementations in, all attempts to start a transaction in the admin would fail with a reflection exception 'Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: object is not an instance of declaring class'. This is because the Proxies that Spring creates for the EntityManager does not implement _all_ the ones that the default Hibernate Session does (since now in Hibernate 5.2 SessionImpl implements the entire JPA spec itself)

The SessionFactory retrieval code failed when attempting to unwrap the Session and retrieve the SessionFactory early on (specifically, instantiation of RuleBuilderServices in the admin) then we would always get a 'No Transactional EntityManager available', possibly because Spring has not injected it early enough, through an @PersistenceContext.

Since we have all of the Hibernate mapping data via PersistentClass statically anyway, it makes more sense to simply leverage than than rely on deprecated methods in SessionFactory"

Added properties to override the default Hibernate naming strategies to fix inconsistencies introduced with upgrade from Hibernate 4 to 5. By default, Broadleaf will use the legacy implicit naming strategy to ensure clients are not impacted until they can make the necessary changes.

Before the upgrade:

```
// from PageImpl
@JoinTable(name = ""BLC_PAGE_RULE_MAP"",
           inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = ""PAGE_RULE_ID"", referencedColumnName = ""PAGE_RULE_ID""))
```

would product the column name (for the join column) `BLC_PAGE_PAGE_ID`.
After the upgrade the name would be `PageImpl_PAGE_ID`.

* Updated EntityDuplicator domain to be more generic and extinsible

- Moved ""add duplicate button"" logic from offer controller to the FormBuilderService so that it can be added to any entity form in the admin
- Used ""add"" row level security to control whether the button is allowed to show
- Moved ""duplicate"" endpoint out of offer controller into AdminBasicEntityController so that it can be used for any entity
- Migrated purpose of EntityDuplicateModifier to EntityDuplicationHelper and added additional capabilities
    - EntityDuplicationHelper must be implemented to enable duplication of a particular entity see OfferDuplicateModifier
    - CopyHints moved from loose collection to be a field of EntityDuplicationHelper
    - Added list bean ""blEntityDuplicationHelpers"" to keep track of all EntityDuplicationHelpers rather than have them be passed into the EntityDuplicator
- Extracted duplicate logic in AdminBasicEntityController and AdminProductController into methods in the superclass
- Added EntityDuplicationHelpers for ContentItem and ContentTargeter

* Made use of superclass constant for repeated view names

* Added copy hints for ContentItem and StructuredContent

- Removed unused import
- Made copied ContetTargeters have lower priority than originals

* Fixed ContentTargeter copying with new hints

- Removed duplicate button in same places as delete button (for now)
- Fixed EntityDuplicationHelper implementation names
- Expanded EntityDuplicator javadocs
- Extracted duplicate code in AdminProductController and its superclass

* Made the default duplicated entity name suffix a system property

- `admin.entity.duplication.suffix.default`
- Default is "" - Copy""

* Fixed tests and added licenses

* Removed unused call to `isNotReadOnly()`"

This change was done because CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for Postgres inserts the time accurate up to fractions of seconds instead of full seconds. This was an issue because when a sub collection is added to an entity that is sandboxable the date field is updated somewhere in the admin pipeline and then the entity was being persisted under the assumption that no fields would be changed. Since the date field changed an error was thrown saying that a production change on a sandboxable entity attempted to be done through the admin.

Currently sending async emails is not intuitive because we create the blEmailService bean using component scanning but we don't autowire the EmailServiceProducer.

The issue was caused by the conditional checking if the tax was zero

there was already a non-zero tax applied it wouldn't be removed when the
tax was changed to needing to be zero. The core logic around this was
moved to applyTaxFactor where now it handles looking for the case where
if a tax record is found and the tax factor to be applied is zero then
the tax record is removed from the list of tax details."

- Refactor the JCacheUtil into a configuration builder class so that JCache Configuration objects can be created without a depenency on the cache manager in order for its use in MergeJCacheManagerFactory
- Implement the ability to define cache regions with Java config so that Broadleaf can provide cache defaults for other cache implementations other than just ehcache
    - Supports automatically generating cache regions from java config if ehcache xml doesn't define them but they're defined in java
    - Supports overriding the ehcache xml cache regions with java config
- Added default JCache java config for known cache regions
- Added conditional annotations to automatically hook up the correct uri provider and configuration builder based on if ehcache is available on the claspath or not
- Improved the JCachePersistenceUnitPostProcessor to have the ability to override some known hibernate cache properties along with allowing for additional jcache implementation specific properties via an injected map
- Create NullSystemProperty class to use for cache missing since by default we were using a proxied implementation of SystemProperty that was serializable and would cause exception when using Redis"
