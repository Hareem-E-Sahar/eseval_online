Motivation:
RFC 2616 specifies a number of headers that are hop-by-hop and proxy
server are required to remove them [1].

The issue I ran into was when the ProxyServlet was deployed on EAP 6.3
and the proxy server set the response header 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked'
which cause the client to fail as the response from the proxy was not
chunked.

Modifications:
Added a check of header names before adding them to them to the
HttpServletRequest.

Motivation:
The reason for this ProtocolSocketFactory implementation is
that for ProxyServlet we don't need to bind to a local address and port.
This binding can cause issue in PaaS environments where restrictions apply.

When HttpConnection's open method calls ProtocolSocketFactory's
 createSocket(String, int, InetAddress, int, HttpConnectionParams)
which by default will use DefaultProtocolSocketFactory's
 createSocket(String, int, InetAddress, int, HttpConnectionParams).
The method that will be invoked will be DefaultProtocolSocketFactory's
 createSocket(String, int, InetAddress, int)
which will call
  return new Socket(host, port, localAddress, localPort);
The above constructor will create a new Socket and connect to the
remote address and port (the first two arguments). It will also
bind() to the local address and port. This is the part that can
cause issue in PaaS environment where there are restrictions.

Modifications:
Provide a NonBindingSocketFactory that ignores the local address and
port avoiding binding to a local address.

Result:
The ProxyServlet is usable in PaaS environments without additional
configuration required by users."

    * Mule helloworld example was moved to regular
    quickstarts project. Fixes #2280.

    * This was achieved by adding bundle type and
    classifier parameters to the fabric8 maven plugin
    (profile zip goal). The classifier parameter was not
    necessary for the mule example, but it seemed logical
    to also offer this feature.

    * All enhancements to the maven plugin are covered
    by tests that use the maven test harness.

    * An archetype was also created for the mule example

    * The archetype permits running the
    autoscale/remote/archetype tests on the mule example,
    which appear to work."
